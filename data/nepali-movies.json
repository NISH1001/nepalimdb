The passengers are able fortuitously to come up with this masquerade as the one acting as the bride is indeed going to Kathmandu to get engaged. The stories of those on board, some whose the delay help, some whose it hurts, are told. The \"bride\", medical student Pooja, is torn between marrying her intended fianc\u00e9 Abiral, just returned from the United States and who she's known since they were children, and her lover Ronit. The \"groom\", Pratiek, whose parents do not approve of his homosexual orientation, has a new boyfriend Vishal, who is facing a personal crisis with his transgendered roommate, Deena. The \"wedding planner\", Manoj, who is in the military, is rushing to see his housemaid wife Radhika before the effects of a fertility concoction he just took wears off, he unaware of things that are happening with her in relation to having a baby. The driver's party girl girlfriend, Kavita, is facing an issue between seeing that her ill daughter gets medical attention and having no money to pay for the services. Their collective lives get even more intertwined beyond their direct interactions on the bus with one specific incident that happens at their destination."

Bhedako Oon Jasto, or Like Sheep's Wool, an hour long documentary, is named after the song he first heard in a highland village north of Kathmandu. It is his deeply personal odyssey in search of the elusive tune. For eight long years, Wagle would sing Bhedako Oon Jasto - to his friends, and then singers and musicians, to check if they were familiar with the tune, but to no avail. Early this year, Wagle has his calls answered. Wagle sings the song to Amrit Gurung of Nepathya. Amrit shows interest to sing the song, and requests Wagle to give him the lyrics in writing. Wagle puts forward a clause - he tells Amrit - \" Both you and me have to revisit the place where I heard this song. You need to get the feel of the local essence, and I need to know more on the people and place - to write the song.\" The travel is agreed upon. Danu - the current bassist of Nepathya, follows them to observe the tunes of the Tungna. For 10 days, Nepathya (Amrit Gurung and Danu), travels with Wagle to the highland village in Langtang. A part-time filmmaker Kiran Krishna Shrestha follows the research process on the search of the song - Bhedako Oon Jasto... Kiran with his camera becomes the 'unseen' fourth character of the film."

The boys can't possibly afford such a bike, but a poster offering a reward for finding a lost dog raises their hopes. The boys experience adventures and set back in their pursuit of dog and bike, through crowded alleys and market places of the old city, into inner sanctum of a prophetic seer, and to an abandoned temple where a 'holy' man steals their money. Overwhelmed by obstacles, their friendship is tested. Through the pursuit of their dreams, however, the boys discover what's really important in life-something bigger than the bicycle."

From Lake Okeechobee, to Stuart, to Belle Glade, to the Everglades, So Flo Floods tells the story of these floods and the issues surrounding where the region is going and what it will need to confront if SLR continues as anticipated. Not only is South Florida home to some of the most knowledgeable experts in the world on SLR, but also to many with related expertise that help So Flo Floods paint a picture of South Florida's economic, environmental, and political realities going forward. There are differences of opinion about what's to come and what to do about it-but not that it's here. We interview professors, mayors, writers, historians, engineers, and others and support their stories with archival and current footage, as well as animation and aerial footage captured over the past two years."

From a family finance supported by money sent by a young son or husband from abroad to a society without any other means of income, there seems to be no way of knowing where the problem begins and ends. The only thing we can do is revisit the present situation of immigration, which is a result of a vicious cycle of individual danger, pain, agitation, fear, and repeated migration. It's not easy for the naive citizens of Nepal who grew up in a feudal agricultural society to delve into the capitalistic economy. What if the agency that introduced foreign employers is a fraud? What if their wage is delayed? What happens to a family without its head for years? What if the money from foreign lands is gone again? Not knowing what will happen next, the citizens of Nepal live another day chasing after the mirage of foreign laborers. Can they really find riyal?"

To the Sherpa people, the ethnic group legendary for their unmatched skill in mountaineering, the mountain is a holy place. Mount Everest is \"Chomolongma\" - Mother Goddess of the Universe. Ironically, Sherpa women have long been discouraged from climbing the powerful and daunting Everest, relegated instead to more traditional roles as homemakers or into support roles in the prestigious climbing industry of Nepal. The documentary follows the five diverse, charismatic women chosen for this historic expedition. Told from a woman's perspective rarely seen on Everest or off, the film is a dramatic, inspiring Everest story and an absorbing portrait of the Sherpa community."

However, their life together takes an unexpected turn as the all too common reality of community expectations, peer pressure and family pressures set in. How should they respond? We first see the couple listening to those around them rather than to each other. They argue more and the distance and suspicions between them grow, until the shocking climax of the film shows just how wrong things can go between a husband and a wife. Take two, the film rewinds and this time the couple stay united despite the same pressures from friends and family. This time there is no shocking climax, at each juncture the couple try to talk and listen to each other and as a result are happier and their marriage is stronger. By showing how two approaches towards the daily pressures faced by a married couple can have such dramatically different consequences, the film asks audiences to reflect on their role in the success of their own marriage. Can happiness & mutual understanding between husband and wife rest in our own hands?"
